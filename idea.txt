PatternMD: Chronic Illness Pattern Detection System
Brand Identity & Positioning
Tagline: "Find your patterns, not just your symptoms."

Brand voice: Clinical but compassionate, data-driven but human. Think "trusted lab partner" not "cold medical device."

Visual identity:

Colors: Deep blue (#1E40AF) for trust, teal (#0D9488) for health/data, soft orange (#F59E0B) for alerts/insights

Logo: Abstract waveform + medical cross, or DNA helix + chart lines

Typography: Clean, highly readable (Inter or Source Sans Pro)

Refined Project Structure with New Name
Core Philosophy Shift
Unlike WebMD which focuses on diagnosis (what you have), PatternMD focuses on pattern recognition (how your condition behaves). This is a crucial distinction both medically and legally.
